    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m John Wesley Paige Jr.—a cybersecurity student, builder, and lifelong learner. You can call me J.P. for short. I’m developing a home lab from the ground up to deepen my skills in cybersecurity, cloud security, and networking. My setup includes pfSense for firewall and VPN access, a TrueNAS server for storage, Suricata as my IDS/IPS, and Splunk as a centralized SIEM. I’ve launched my own self-hosted website, integrated Active Directory with Windows Server, and am experimenting with hybrid cloud environments using AWS and Azure.</p>
    <p>But beyond the tech, my mission is personal: I’m committed to bettering myself so I can uplift my family, community, and ultimately, my nation. I never thought I would be here. I have grown so much as a man, a father, a son, a brother and friend. I’m thankful for the progress I’ve made, but I never let gratitude become complacency. I believe in staying hungry, staying humble, and always seeking to be greater, not for myself but for the ones that I love, my community and my country. So welcome and thanks for visiting, it means the world to me.</p>
