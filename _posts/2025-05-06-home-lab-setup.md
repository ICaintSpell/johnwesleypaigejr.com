I am a HUGE Gundam nerd All of my devices are themed based on vehicles, equipment or vessels from the 'Universal Century' time line. And so I saw it fitting that for my network the name should follow that same schema. So.... WELCOME TO SIDE 3!!! IYKTYK

Having a physical firewall and IDS/IPS running in my own environment is a game-changer for understanding network defense concepts. Next up: getting all the logs piped into Splunk correctly.
