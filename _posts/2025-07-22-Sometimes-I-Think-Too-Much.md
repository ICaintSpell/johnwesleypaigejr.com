So… I’m sitting here listening to music finishing up term #4 of my college career and my thoughts wonder. I started thinking about where I would like to go professionally. Exactly what direction I would like my career to go in, and the more I think, the more I come to the realization that I’m not really sure. There are so many things I do not understand, and I feel like without the full understanding of things unknown, how could I ever pick a direction. I hear “you have to find a niche”, to “pick a lane”, I guess I have analysis paralysis. Maybe I’m putting too much thought into it all and I just need to chill out…. Who knows…. There is 2 things I have been advised about when it comes to moving forward; and those 2 things are CloudSec and learning Splunk. So I reckon with that being said, I think I will go and try to find a Cybersecurity road map of sorts to see what my options are when it comes to those two things….
