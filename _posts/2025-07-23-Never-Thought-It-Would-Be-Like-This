Last night and this morning I have been doing a COMPLETE revamp of my site, and I'll say this; I do not code, I do not like coding and God bless althose who do... 

I really fell down the rabbit hole on this one and I'm just glad I'm done. 

Now the question is what direction do I go in now, do I work on EDR/AV OR do I start learning and implementing Splunk? I have a week off until the new quarter starts, and so I have some free time. Decisions decisions....
